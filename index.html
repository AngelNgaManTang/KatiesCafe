        <p class="section_cafe_about_us_paragraphs">
            We are a local coffee shop located in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. We are a couple born 
            in the UK and decided to start move to Hong Kong 4 years ago. We opened up Katie's 
            Cafe 2 years ago after working for many different coffee shops around Hong Kong. 
            We decided that it would be best for us to open up our own shop and offer our own 
            favourite dishes and create our own community.
        </p>
        <p class="section_cafe_about_us_paragraphs">
            All of our products are locally sourced as when we first opened we felt it was 
            important to support others in the community and have very fresh produce to use.
